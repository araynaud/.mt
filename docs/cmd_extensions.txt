If you use the Command Processor Extensions (which is default on Windows 2000 and later) then you can use the following optional syntax:

%~1         - expands %1 removing any surrounding quotes (")
%~f1        - expands %1 to a fully qualified path name
%~d1        - expands %1 to a drive letter only
%~p1        - expands %1 to a path only
%~n1        - expands %1 to a file name only
%~x1        - expands %1 to a file extension only
%~s1        - expanded path contains short names only
%~a1        - expands %1 to file attributes
%~t1        - expands %1 to date/time of file
%~z1        - expands %1 to size of file
The modifiers can be combined to get compound results:

%~dp1       - expands %1 to a drive letter and path only
%~nx1       - expands %1 to a file name and extension only
So your command would look something like this:

if exist %2\%~nx1 ren %2\%~nx1 %~n1_standby%~x1
