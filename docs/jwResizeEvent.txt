Detecting FULLSCREEN exit

I am wanting to detect when the user returns from FullScreen.

I have a listener that is trigger when the user enters fullscreen but does not detect when the user exits fullscreen.

When entering fullscreen the alert('fullscreen change detected'); is opened. But does not open on exiting fullscreen.
<script type="text/javascript">
    var player;
    function playerReady(obj) {
        player = gid(obj.id);
        addListeners();
    };

    function gid(name) {
        return document.getElementById(name);
    };

    function addListeners() {
        playlist = player.getPlaylist();               
        if ((playlist !== null) && (playlist.length > 0)) {
            player.addViewListener('FULLSCREEN','fullscreenHandler');
        } else {
            setTimeout("addListeners()", 100);
        }
    };

    function fullscreenHandler(obj) {
        alert('fullscreen change detected');
        if (obj.state = false) {
            alert('exited full screen');
        }
    };
</script>

Is it possible to detect the exit from fullscreen?

Thanks,

Marcus.

The FULLSCREEN event is only triggered when someone exits fullscreen by clicking the controlbar button. If someone exits by pressing [ESC], the event is not triggered.

Instead, it's best to listen to the RESIZE event. This one will be triggered. It has three properties: height, width and fullscreen. If you get a resize event with the property fullscreen=false, while the previous resize had fullscreen=true, the user just exited fullscreen.
